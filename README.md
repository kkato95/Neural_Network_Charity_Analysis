# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis - Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and nerual networks to predict where to make investments. We are creating a binary classifier that predicts the whether or not the application will be susccessful if funded by AlphabetSoup. The dataset contains information on the organizions funded by AlphabetSoup.


Deliverable 1: 
The analysis included binning the values in several of our columns, then merged the OneHotCoded features into single dataframe. Next, we scaled the data.

Deliverable 2:
The purpose of this deliverable is to run the deep neural network. We bgan by declaring a sequantial nerual model, then we added the hidden layers. Then the model was complied and train. The evaluation of the model shows an accuracy of .


## Results

#### Data Preprocessing

1. What variables are considered the targets for you model?


2. What variables are considered to be the features for your model?


3. What variables are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?



#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

1. How many neurons, layer, and activation functions did you select from your neural network model, and why?

2. Were you able to acheive the target model preformance?

3. What steps did you take to try and increase model preformances?
